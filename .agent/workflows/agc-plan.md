# /agc-plan Workflow

This workflow transforms a rough idea into a concrete product plan and requirements document.

## Steps

1.  **Brainstorming & Ideation**
    - Use key: `brainstorming`
    - Goal: Generate feature ideas, explore alternatives, and define the core value proposition.
    - Output: A list of prioritized features and concepts.

2.  **Feasibility Check**
    - Use key: `senior-architect`
    - Goal: Assess technical feasibility and high-level constraints.
    - Output: Technical risk assessment.

3.  **Requirements Definition**
    - Use key: `product-manager` (New Skill)
    - Goal: Write detailed User Stories and Acceptance Criteria.
    - Output: A draft Product Requirements Document (PRD).

4.  **Finalize Plan**
    - Use key: `writing-plans`
    - Goal: Synthesize all inputs into a final `PRD.md` artifact.
    - Instruction: Create a file named `PRD.md` in the current directory with the full plan.

## Iron Rules
1. If there is anything unclear, ask the user instead of inventing new stuff. Unless the user explicitly tells the AI to invent or suggest ideas.

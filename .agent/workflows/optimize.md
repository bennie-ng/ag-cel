# /optimize - Performance Optimization Command

## Purpose

Analyze and optimize code performance.

## Usage

```
/optimize [file or function]
```

---

Optimize: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Workflow

1. **Analyze Current Performance**
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Check complexity
   - Profile if possible

2. **Identify Opportunities**
   - Algorithm improvements
   - Caching opportunities
   - Async optimizations

3. **Implement Optimizations**
   - Make targeted changes
   - Verify improvements
   - Ensure correctness

## Output

```markdown
## Optimization Report

### Before
- Time complexity: O(n²)
- Estimated time: 500ms

### After
- Time complexity: O(n log n)
- Estimated time: 50ms

### Changes Made
- [Description of optimizations]

## Gap Analysis Rule
Always identify gaps and suggest next steps to users. In case there is no gaps anymore, then AI should clearly state that there is no gap left.

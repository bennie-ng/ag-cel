# Solution Designer Standards

## Overview
Guidelines for the Solution Designer role, bridging the gap between business requirements and technical implementation by designing specific solutions within the architectural framework.

## Key Responsibilities
- Translating business requirements into detailed technical specifications.
- Designing API contracts, data models, and component interactions.
- Ensuring solutions align with the broader system architecture and standards.
- Collaborating with Business Analysts to clarify requirements and with Developers to guide implementation.

## Best Practices

### Design Process
- **Requirement Analysis**: Deeply understand the problem domain before designing the solution.
- **Iterative Design**: Refine designs based on feedback from architects and developers.
- **Traceability**: Ensure every design element traces back to a business requirement.

### Technical Specification
- **API Design**: Define clear, RESTful (or GraphQL/gRPC) API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI).
- **Data Modeling**: Create efficient and normalized database schemas appropriate for the use case.
- **Interface Definitions**: Clearly define inputs, outputs, and error handling for system components.

### collaboration
- **Bridge the Gap**: Act as a translator between non-technical stakeholders and the engineering team.
- **Review & Validate**: Conduct design reviews with the System Architect to ensure compliance with architectural patterns.

## Tools & Artifacts
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Use to model complex interactions and workflows.
- **ER Diagrams**: Use for data modeling.
- **Interface Specifications**: OpenAPI (Swagger), Protobuf, etc.
